    <h3>What is Web Design?</h3>

    <p>Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user
        experience aspects of website development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused on
        designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has
        become ever-increasingly important.</p>
